# TikTok Title Sentiment Analysis by Joseph Kim -- Python 3.9

Extracting engagement and title data from the TikTok "For You" page through BeautifulSoup, and performing sentiment analysis through NLTK.

'TikTok Webscraper.py' creates a pandas Dataframe containing video title and engagement (likes, shares, comments, etc.) data.
'TikTok-Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb' is a jupyter notebook that visualizes sentiment analysis process of the TikTok video titles. NOTE: NLTK tokenizer libraries need to be downloaded independently. 

Legal: as per TikTok's 'robot.txt', webscraping HTML data from the TikTok website is allowed.
